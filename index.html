            When we were kids in the backyard
Playing astronauts and rockstars
No one told us to stop it
Called us unrealistic
Then suddenly, you're eighteen
Go to college for your plan "B"
What you want is too risky
Live for weekends and whiskey
We all got these big ideas
One day, they're replaced with fears
How did we get here?
Darlin', don't quit your daydream
It's your life that you're making
It ain't big enough if it doesn't scare the hell out of you
If it makes you nervous
It's probably worth it
Why save it for sleep when you could be living your daydream?
Thirty-one, waiting tables
She has a voice of an angel
Out of money and power
She only sings in the shower
All these things we say we'll get to
Shot down by the reasons not to
Darlin', don't quit your daydream
It's your life that you're making
It ain't big enough if it doesn't scare the hell out of you
If it makes you nervous
It's probably worth it
Why save it for sleep when you could be living your daydream?
So scared of failure that we fail to try
Turnin' around before the finish line
Gotta fall for a minute before you can fly
So daydream
It's your life that you're making
It ain't big enough if it doesn't scare the hell out of you
If it makes you nervous
It's probably worth it
Why save it for sleep when you could be living your daydream?
Why save it for sleep when you should be living your daydream?
